All Little Victories: A Fiction Twine Story on Ukrainian Stolen Children. 



## Introduction 

"All Little Victories" is an digital storytelling project aimed at raising awareness of the human impact of geopolitical conflicts, with a specific focus on the experiences of children in war zones. This interactive digital narrative seeks to shed light on the human experiences behind the headlines, exploring themes of resilience, separation, and the enduring spirit of individuals caught in the crossfire of conflict.

This project was created for the course on **Digital Publishing**, run by [Isaac Pante](https://github.com/ipante) at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/) (UNIL).

**Author**: _Marcela Havrilova_ (<marcela.havrilova@unil.ch>)

**Date**: _Autumn semester, 2023_

## Objectives

"All Little Victories" is an digital storytelling project aimed at raising awareness of the human impact of geopolitical conflicts, with a specific focus on the experiences of children in war zones. This project is rooted in the following objectives:

**Awareness and Empathy:** To shed light on the real-world implications of geopolitical events, particularly their effects on children. By providing an immersive experience combining text, images, and sounds, the project aims to foster empathy and understanding among users.

**Documentary Approach:** While the project is fictional, it draws heavily from real-life events and stories. Information and narratives are meticulously researched and sourced from traditional newspapers and channels. This approach ensures a grounded and authentic representation of the experiences of children affected by war. All the inspiratins are noter under references

**Historical Context and Universality:** The project, inspired by various conflicts, including the recent situation in Ukraine, aims to present a broader picture of the complexities and challenges faced by children in war zones throughout history. It echoes themes found in other works, such as the game "We Happy Few," which explores the evacuation of children during World War II.

**Resilience and Courage:** At the heart of "All Little Victories" is a tribute to the resilience and bravery of children caught in the midst of war. Their stories of lost schooling, disrupted lives, and the struggle to maintain a semblance of normalcy highlight both their vulnerability and their remarkable strength.

## Project Structure

The narrative of "All Little Victories" is structured into a series of interconnected nodes, each representing key moments, decisions, and experiences of the characters. The story follows the journeys of several individuals, each bringing a unique perspective to the profound impacts of war:

**Volodymyr:** A dedicated journalist uncovering the hidden stories of the conflict. His journey takes readers into the depths of the refugee camps and the lives affected by the war.

**Nadya:** A mother whose strength and determination are put to the test as she embarks on a perilous journey to reunite with her son. Her story is one of unwavering love and the lengths a mother will go to protect her child.

**Olexandr:** A young boy caught in the turmoil of war, Olexandr's story is one of innocence lost and resilience found. After being forcibly taken from his home and family, he navigates a world far removed from the warmth and familiarity of his childhood. His experiences in the filtration camp and subsequent journey reflect the confusion and struggle faced by many children in war zones. Olexandr's tale is a poignant reminder of the war's impact on the youngest and most vulnerable.

Through these characters, readers navigate the complexities of war, making choices that influence the story's outcome and engaging with themes that resonate universally.
